## Experience with Flare

Building the game was a fantastic experience, despite facing some challenges with the Flare network—including a bug in the official contracts. Thankfully, the Flare team was incredibly responsive, resolving the issue within seconds. Their support was outstanding, and working with them was a pleasure. If it had been the Ethereum team, I probably would have waited a month!

The official documentation proved invaluable, providing everything I needed. Flare’s RNG is an exceptional feature—I only wish I had discovered it sooner, as it would have been perfect for my previous project. Though I found Flare a bit late, I’m glad I did. Overall, it was a fun and rewarding journey!
